Introduction to Data Modeling
    Data in MongoDB has a flexible schema. Collections do not enforce document structure by default. This flexibility gives you data-modeling choices to match your application and its performance requirements.

    MongoDB doesn't enforce how data is organized by default.
    So how can we decide what structure to use to store our data?
    Where should we create subdocuments?
    And where should we use arrays of values?
    At which point should the data get its own collection?
    Making these decisions about the shape and structure of your data is called data modeling.
    More specifically, data modeling is a way to organize fields in a document to support your application
    performance and querying capabilities.

    data modeling with MongoDB, data that is accessed together should be stored together.
