Video: Aggregation Structure and Syntax

    https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/meta/aggregation-quick-reference/?_ga=2.251688969.1055797164.1667893254-1691168424.1665041282

    In the db.collection.aggregate() method, pipeline stages appear in an array. Documents pass through the stages in sequence. All except the $out, $merge, and $geoNear stages can appear multiple times in a pipeline.

    db.collection.aggregate( [ { <stage> }, ... ] )

    db.orders.aggregate( [

        // Stage 1: Filter pizza order documents by pizza size
        {
            $match: { size: "medium" }
        },

        // Stage 2: Group remaining documents by pizza name and calculate total quantity
        {
            $group: { _id: "$name", totalQuantity: { $sum: "$quantity" } }
        }

    ] )

    Operators and Expressions

    Operators   
        Query: $in, $gte, $eq, etc.
        Aggregation: $match, $group, $project, etc.

    Expressions
        are like functions, we provide parameters and they provide computed output
        expressions can be composed to form powerful data transformation

        Expressions can include field paths, literals, system variables, expression objects, and expression operators. Expressions can be nested.

        Expression Objects
            { <field1>: <expression1>, ... }
        
        Operator Expressions
            { <operator>: [ <argument1>, <argument2> ... ] }

        Arithmetic Expression Operators
        Array Expression Operators
        Boolean Expression Operators
        Comparison Expression Operators
        Conditional Expression Operators
        Custom Aggregation Expression Operators
        Data Size Expression Operators
        Date Expression Operators
        Literal Expression Operator
        Miscellaneous Operators
        Object Expression Operators
        Set Expression Operators
        String Expression Operators
        Text Expression Operator
        Trigonometry Expression Operators
        Type Expression Operators
        Accumulators ($group)
        Accumulators (in Other Stages)
        Variable Expression Operators
