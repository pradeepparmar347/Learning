Chapter 4: Advanced CRUD Operations

Lecture: Array Operators and Sub-Documents

    To query an array field by a specific element location or to query an element in sub-documents, MQL uses dot-notation to specify the address of these elements in the doc.

    You can use dot-notation to go as deep into the nested document as you wish.

    To use dot-notation with arrays, specify the position of the element in the array.

Lab 1: Querying Arrays and Sub-Documents
    Problem:

        How many trips in the sample_training.trips collection started at stations that are to the west of the -74 longitude coordinate?

        Longitude decreases in value as you move west.

        Note: We always list the longitude first and then latitude in the coordinate pairs; i.e.

        <field_name>: [ <longitude>, <latitude> ]

    Solution: 
        db.trips.find({"start station location.coordinates.0": {$lt: -74}}).count()
        1928

Lab 2: Querying Arrays and Sub-Documents
    Problem:
        How many inspections from the sample_training.inspections collection were conducted in the city of NEW YORK?

    Solution:
        db.inspections.find({"address.city":"NEW YORK"}).count()
        18279

Quiz: Querying Arrays and Sub-documents
